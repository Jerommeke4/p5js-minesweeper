#Minesweeper js

This is a minesweeper game written in p5.js. Since minesweeper does not use the loop actively. The reason behind using P5.js is a bit unnecessary. But I thought it was fun.

Have fun with this piece of hobby material.

Installation
------------
This package needs `bower` for installation to install the p5js framework.

use 
``
bower install
``
to make sure everything is installed properly
